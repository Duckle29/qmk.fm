# Wedges

This directory has 3D printable wedges you can use to tilt the keyboard. The f360 source is provided and has a parametric angle you can change. If you can't use f360, then a 6deg step is also provided, and it should be trivial to alter the angle in most CAD packages. If you can't use either aproaches, then open an issue and request a specific angle from me on my fork: https://github.com/Duckle29/qmk.fm/
